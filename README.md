## welcome to my GitHub page!

<img src="nyancat.gif"> hi i'm des! i like making web pages and designing them. i started out with a personal website over @ [doqmeat.neocities.org](https://doqmeat.neocities.org/) which turned into something i would never ever imagined. i had too much fun with html and css and now i'm studying computer science to see what else i can do in this world.

i also have other projects which are linked @ [doqmeat.github.io](https://doqmeat.github.io/)
